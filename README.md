Objective:
The objective of this project is to provide healthcare professionals with comprehensive insights into patient admissions, outcomes, and medical conditions. This dashboard enables hospitals and administrators to monitor key health metrics, track admission trends, and identify critical areas of improvement for better patient care and resource allocation.

Key Features:
ðŸ”¸ Admission Analysis:

Visualizes admissions by type (Emergency/OPD), gender, rural/urban locality, and time period (month/year), helping to understand trends in patient flow.
ðŸ”¸ Patient Demographics:

Displays patient demographics such as age distribution and gender ratio, offering insights into the types of patients visiting the facility.
ðŸ”¸ Medical Outcomes:

Summarizes patient outcomes (e.g., survived, deceased) and correlates them with factors like ICU stay duration, comorbidities, and medical history.
ðŸ”¸ Health Metrics:

Analyzes key laboratory results (HB, TLC, Platelets, Glucose, Urea, Creatinine, BNP) and their association with patient outcomes.
ðŸ”¸ Complication Trends:

Highlights the prevalence of critical conditions such as heart failure, STEMI, ACS, AKI, and CVA, enabling the identification of high-risk areas.
ðŸ”¸ Lifestyle Risk Factors:

Evaluates the impact of smoking, alcohol use, and chronic diseases (DM, HTN, CKD) on patient health and outcomes.
ðŸ”¸ Doctorâ€™s Notes Integration:

Includes qualitative insights from doctors' notes to supplement quantitative analysis, aiding in comprehensive patient reviews.
Key Insights:
ðŸ”¸ Admission Trends:

Emergency admissions are significantly higher during certain months, suggesting seasonal patterns or healthcare demands.
ðŸ”¸ Patient Demographics:

The majority of patients are between 40-60 years of age, with a higher ratio of male patients in rural areas.
ðŸ”¸ Outcomes and Risk Factors:

Patients with chronic diseases such as CKD, HTN, and CAD show a higher likelihood of ICU stays and adverse outcomes.
ðŸ”¸ Laboratory and Cardiac Indicators:

Elevated BNP and raised cardiac enzymes are strong predictors of complications like ACS, STEMI, and heart failure.
ðŸ”¸ Complications Overview:

Heart failure and ACS are among the most common complications, requiring targeted interventions.
Conclusion:
This Healthcare - Patient Details Dashboard in Power BI is a robust tool designed to help healthcare providers gain actionable insights into patient data. By leveraging this dashboard, hospitals can optimize patient care, allocate resources effectively, and improve health outcomes through data-driven decisions.
